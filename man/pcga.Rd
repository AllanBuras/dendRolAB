\title{
Compute a Principal Component Gradient Analysis
}
\description{
pcga makes use of an ordinary PCA to compute the similarity of tree-ring series based on the loadings of the first two principal components. 
x-y-coordinates of PC-loadings are transformed into polar coordinates which are used to define a gradient of similarity along the loadings. 
}
\usage{
pcga(DATA,plot.CI=T)
}
\arguments{
  \item{DATA}{
An rwl.data.frame such as the one generated by read.rwl in the dplR-package.
}
\item{plot.CI}{
Specify whether the common overlap period shall be plotted. Defaults to TRUE.
}
}
\details{
pcga automatically extracts the common overlap period of the rwl.data.frame. If this period is too short, results may be meaningless -->
consider removing too short series. Moreover, detrending has an important impact on the results obtained by pcga. Depending on research
questions you may consider using rigorous detrending techniques to emphasize high-frequency variability (e.g. polynomial spline or autoregressive models) 
or representations of absolute growth such as basal area increments (bai.in and bai.out in 'dplR').
